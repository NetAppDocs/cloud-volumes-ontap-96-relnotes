Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in Google Cloud Platform as a single node system. Two pricing options are available: pay as you go and Bring Your Own License (BYOL).

== Pay-as-you-go overview

* Offers Cloud Volumes ONTAP in three different licensing options: Explore, Standard, and Premium.
* A 30-day free trial is available for the first Cloud Volumes ONTAP system that you deploy in Google Cloud.
** There are no hourly software charges, but Google Cloud infrastructure charges still apply (compute, storage, and networking).
** When the free trial ends, you'll be charged hourly according to the selected license, https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager[as long as you subscribed^]. If you haven't subscribed, the system shuts down.
* Conversions from PAYGO to BYOL aren't currently supported.
* Basic technical support is offered, but you must register and activate the NetApp serial number associated with your system.
