[.lead]
Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in AWS in two pricing options: pay-as-you-go and Bring Your Own License (BYOL). For pay-as-you-go, you can choose from three configurations: Explore, Standard, or Premium.

== Supported configurations by license

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in AWS as a single node system and as a high-availability (HA) pair of nodes for fault tolerance and nondisruptive operations.

Upgrading a single node system to an HA pair is not supported. If you want to switch between a single node system and an HA pair, then you need to deploy a new system and replicate data from the existing system to the new system.

Notes:

. When you choose an EC2 instance type, you can specify whether it is a shared instance or a dedicated instance.

. These instance types include local NVMe storage, which Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses as _Flash Cache_. Flash Cache speeds access to data through real-time intelligent caching of recently read user data and NetApp metadata. It is effective for random read-intensive workloads, including databases, email, and file services. Compression must be disabled on all volumes to take advantage of the Flash Cache performance improvements. link:reference-limitations-aws.html#flash-cache-limitations[Learn more].

. c5d.18xlarge and m5d.8xlarge are supported starting with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 P3.

. Enhanced write performance is enabled when using SSDs with Cloud Volumes ONTAP Standard, Premium, and BYOL.

. gp3 SSDs are not supported.

. For some HA configurations, disk limits prevent you from reaching the 368 TiB capacity limit by using disks alone. In those cases, you can reach the 368 TiB capacity limit by https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-cloud-volumes-ontap/concept-data-tiering.html[tiering inactive data to object storage^]. For information about disk limits, refer to link:reference-limits-aws.html[storage limits].

. For AWS region support, see https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-volumes-global-regions[Cloud Volumes Global Regions^].

== Supported disk sizes

In AWS, an aggregate can contain up to 6 disks that are all the same type and size.
