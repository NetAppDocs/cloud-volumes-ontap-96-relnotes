Cloud Volumes ONTAP has storage configuration limits to provide reliable operations. For best performance, do not configure your system at the maximum values.

== Maximum system capacity by license

The maximum system capacity for a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is determined by its license. The maximum system capacity includes disk-based storage plus object storage used for data tiering. NetApp doesn't support exceeding this limit.

[cols="25,75",width=55%,options="header"]
|===
| License
| Maximum system capacity (disks + object storage)

| Explore	| 2 TiB (data tiering is not supported with Explore)
| Standard | 10 TiB
| Premium | 368 TiB
| BYOL | 368 TiB per license

|===

===== For HA, is the license capacity limit per node or for the entire HA pair?

The capacity limit is for the entire HA pair. It is not per node. For example, if you use the Premium license, you can have up to 368 TiB of capacity between both nodes.

== Disk and tiering limits by VM size

The disk limits below are specific to disks that contain user data. The limits do not include the boot disk and root disk. The tables below show the maximum system capacity by VM size with disks or alone, and with disks and cold data tiering to object storage.

Disk limits are shown by VM size for Premium and BYOL licenses only because disk limits can’t be reached with Explore or Standard licenses due to system capacity limits.

* Single node systems can use Standard HDD Managed Disks, Standard SSD Managed Disks, and Premium SSD Managed Disks, with up to 32 TiB per disk. The number of supported disks varies by VM size.

* HA systems use Premium page blobs as disks, with up to 8 TiB per page blob. The number of supported disks varies by VM size.

=== Single node with a Premium license

=== Single node with one or more BYOL licenses

NOTE: For some VM types, you'll need several BYOL licenses to reach the max system capacity listed below. For example, you'd need 6 BYOL licenses to reach 2 PiB with DS5_v2.

== Aggregate limits

Cloud Volumes ONTAP uses Azure storage as disks and groups them into _aggregates_. Aggregates provide storage to volumes.

[cols=2*,options="header,autowidth"]
|===
| Parameter
| Limit

| Maximum number of aggregates | Same as the disk limit
| Maximum aggregate size |
352 TiB of raw capacity for single node ^1,^ ^2^
96 TiB of raw capacity for HA pairs ^1^
| Disks per aggregate	| 1-12 ^3^
| Maximum number of RAID groups per aggregate	| 1
|===

Notes:

. The aggregate capacity limit is based on the disks that comprise the aggregate. The limit does not include object storage used for data tiering.

. The 352 TiB limit is supported starting with 9.6 P3. Releases prior to 9.6 P3 support up to 200 TiB of raw capacity in an aggregate on a single node system.

. All disks in an aggregate must be the same size.

== Logical storage limits

[cols="22,22,56",width=100%,options="header"]
|===
| Logical storage
| Parameter
| Limit

| *Storage virtual machines (SVMs)*	| Maximum number for Cloud Volumes ONTAP
(HA pair or single node) | One data-serving SVM and one destination SVM used for disaster recovery. You can activate the destination SVM for data access if there’s an outage on the source SVM. ^1^

The one data-serving SVM spans the entire Cloud Volumes ONTAP system (HA pair or single node).
.2+| *Files*	| Maximum size | 16 TiB
| Maximum per volume |	Volume size dependent, up to 2 billion
| *FlexClone volumes*	| Hierarchical clone depth ^2^ | 499
.3+| *FlexVol volumes*	| Maximum per node |	500
| Minimum size |	20 MB
| Maximum size | 100 TiB
| *Qtrees* |	Maximum per FlexVol volume |	4,995
| *Snapshot copies* |	Maximum per FlexVol volume |	1,023

|===

Notes:

. Cloud Manager does not provide any setup or orchestration support for SVM disaster recovery. It also does not support storage-related tasks on an additional SVM. You must use System Manager or the CLI for SVM disaster recovery.

. Hierarchical clone depth is the maximum depth of a nested hierarchy of FlexClone volumes that can be created from a single FlexVol volume.
