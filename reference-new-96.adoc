== 9.6 GA (15 July 2019)

The General Availability (GA) release of Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 is now available. The GA release includes bug fixes. Cloud Manager will prompt you to upgrade your existing systems to this release.

NOTE: Cloud Volumes ONTAP remains in private preview in Google Cloud Platform.

== 9.6 RC1 (16 June 2019)

Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 RC1 is available in AWS, Azure, and now in Google Cloud Platform. This release includes the following features.

* <<Private preview of Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud Platform>>
* <<Data tiering with HA pairs in Azure>>
* <<Support for FlexCache volumes>>
* <<Additional ONTAP changes>>

=== Private preview of Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud Platform

A private preview of Cloud Volumes ONTAP in Google Cloud Platform is now available. Similar to other cloud providers, Cloud Volumes ONTAP for Google Cloud Platform helps you reduce costs, improve performance, and increase availability.

Cloud Volumes ONTAP is available in GCP as a single node system and supports data tiering to object storage.

To join the private preview, send a request to ng-Cloud-Volume-ONTAP-preview@netapp.com.

=== Data tiering with HA pairs in Azure

Data tiering is now supported with Cloud Volumes ONTAP HA pairs in Microsoft Azure. Data tiering enables automated tiering of inactive data to low-cost Blob storage.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/task_tiering.html[Learn how to set up data tiering in Cloud Manager^].

=== Support for FlexCache volumes

A FlexCache volume is a storage volume that caches NFS read data from an origin (or source) volume. Subsequent reads to the cached data result in faster access to that data.

You can use FlexCache volumes to speed up access to data or to offload traffic from heavily accessed volumes. FlexCache volumes help improve performance, especially when clients need to access the same data repeatedly, because the data can be served directly without having to access the origin volume. FlexCache volumes work well for system workloads that are read-intensive.

Cloud Manager does not provide management of FlexCache volumes at this time, but you can use the ONTAP CLI or ONTAP System Manager to create and manage FlexCache volumes:

* http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.pow-fc-mgmt/home.html[FlexCache Volumes for Faster Data Access Power Guide^]
* http://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/topic/com.netapp.doc.onc-sm-help-960/GUID-07F4C213-076D-4FE8-A8E3-410F49498D49.html[Creating FlexCache volumes in System Manager^]

Starting with the 3.7.2 release, Cloud Manager generates a FlexCache license for all new Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems. The license includes a 500 GiB usage limit.

=== Additional ONTAP changes

ONTAP 9.6 includes other changes that Cloud Volumes ONTAP users might be interested in:

* SnapMirror replication now supports TLS 1.2 encryption for communication in-flight
* Data tiering (FabricPool) enhancements include:
** Volume move support without needing to re-tier cold data
** SVM disaster recovery support

For more details about the 9.6 release, see the https://library.netapp.com/ecm/ecm_download_file/ECMLP2492508[ONTAP 9 Release Notes^].

== Upgrade notes

* Upgrades of Cloud Volumes ONTAP must be completed from Cloud Manager. You should not upgrade Cloud Volumes ONTAP by using System Manager or the CLI. Doing so can impact system stability.

* You can upgrade to Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.6 from the 9.5 release.

* The upgrade of a single node system takes the system offline for up to 25 minutes, during which I/O is interrupted.

* Upgrading an HA pair is nondisruptive and I/O is uninterrupted. During this nondisruptive upgrade process, each node is upgraded in tandem to continue serving I/O to clients.
